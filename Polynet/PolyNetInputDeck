# This is an input deck for the program PolyNet.
#
# This file is in a format made to be read by the GetParameter functions,
# which are defined in ReadInputDeck.h and ReadInputDeck.cpp.
# There is also a special "GetColor" function for specifying colors in 
# graphics. Colors can be specified by one of the color strings defined in
# ReadInputDeck.cpp, or as a trio of RGB values in [0, 255].
#
# Syntax for specifying parameters on a single line is as follows:
#
# [ParameterName] [Any amount of whitespace] [Value(s)]
#
# A "#" symbol denotes comments. Anything on a line after a "#" will
# be ignored. GetParameter functions can handle int-valued, double-valued, and
# string-valued parameters. Double-valued parameters should be specified
# in the input deck in the usual c-style format: 12, -12, 12., 12.3, 3.14e0,
# -3.14e4, +3.14e-3, etc, are all examples of valid specifications for
# double-valued parameters.
#
# If a given parameter is not found specified in the input deck, it will
# instead be given its default value. Default values for all parameters are
# given in PolyNet.h
#
# Parameter names are not case sensitive.
